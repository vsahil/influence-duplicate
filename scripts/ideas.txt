Possible modifications to make to the overall process:
1. Change the data distribution: Generate 20 random samplings of the data, keep all the mappings from the inital datset though
2. Change the neural network architecture:
    a. Hidden 1 layer: 16 24, 32  : 3 
    b. Hidden 2 layer: 8, 12  : 2
3. Training batch size: 50, 100 : 2
6. Filter by 70% training accuracy. 
4. We have only one scheme now which is scheme 8: 1
